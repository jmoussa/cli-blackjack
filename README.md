# CLI Blackjack Game

I was bored so I made a quick CLI Blackjack game. Now you can look like you're doing work but really be playing blackjack!

#### More improvements coming
- Splitting out the codebase
- Eliminate redundancies

**environment.yml is used for anaconda python environment**


To Run:
```
$ python game.py
```
