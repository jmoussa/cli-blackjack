# CLI Blackjack Game

I was bored so I made a quick CLI Blackjack game. Now you can look like you're doing work but really be playing blackjack!


### Requirements
- Python 3.7
- Anaconda/Miniconda (optional since there aren't too many uncommon libraries at use)
    - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    - `conda activate blackjack`


### More improvements coming
- Splitting out the codebase into more modular components
- Eliminate redundancies
- Code in basic strategy for the dealer
- Multiplayer via socket connection?
- Turn into a simulator and run analysis on gameplay?


### To Run:
```
$ python game.py
```
