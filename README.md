# CLI Blackjack Game

I was bored so I made a quick CLI Blackjack game. Now you can look like you're doing work but really be playing blackjack!

#### More improvements coming
- Splitting out the codebase into more modular components
- Eliminate redundancies
- Code in basic strategy for the dealer
- Multiplayer via socket connection?
- Turn into a simulator and run analysis on gameplay?

**environment.yml is used for anaconda python environment**


To Run:
```
$ python game.py
```
